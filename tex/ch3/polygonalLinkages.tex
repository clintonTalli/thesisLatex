\chapter{Realizability of Polygonal Linkages with Fixed Orientation\label{chapter:polygonalLinkage}}

We begin the chapter with describing several gadgets that translates the associated graph $A(\Phi)$ of a planar 3-SAT instance.  
These gadgets will be used together to form a special hexagonal tiling that behaves in a similar nature to the logic engine of Chapter \ref{chapter:logicEngine} but simulate a Planar 3-SAT and its associated graph.
The hexagonal tiling with then be used to prove the following theorem:
\begin{thm}\label{thm:hinge2}
It is strongly NP-hard to decide whether a polygonal linkage whose hinge graph is a \textbf{tree} can be realized with counter-clockwise orientation.
\end{thm}
