\paragraph{Horizontal Displacement $\beta$}

We show that the relative horizontal displacement between two vertically adjacent obstacle hexagons is small and polynomial size.
We first identify where horizontal displacement can occur in the modified auxiliary construction.

(b) shows the same obstacle hexagons and corridors with the exception that the skinny rhombus is not in cannonical position. (c) is the same as (b) with the exception that the obstacle hexagon $O_{i+1}$ has rotation displacement.  (d) shows the rotation that is between the central flag and $O_i$.}\label{fig:someRangeSkinny.pdf}

The central flag and the skinny rhombus have three degrees of freedom.  
Figure \ref{fig:someRangeSkinny.pdf}(a) shows the cannonical position of all objects.  
Figure \ref{fig:someRangeSkinny.pdf}(b) illustrates some range of angular motion $\omega_i$ that a skinny rhombus can rotate on its hinge with a flag.  
Figure \ref{fig:someRangeSkinny.pdf}(c) shows a rotational displacement of $O_{i+1}$ with the skinny rhombus' angular displacement.
Figure \ref{fig:someRangeSkinny.pdf}(d) is the same as (c) with the exception of an addtional rotation $\phi_i$ that is between the central flag and $O_i$.  
Each of these rotations can create horizontal displacement.  
Let $\beta_{\alpha_i}$ be the horizontal displacement generated by the rotational displacement of $O_i$.  
Let $\beta_{\omega_i}$ be the horizontal displacement generated by the rotational displacement between the skinny rhombus and the central flag.  
Lastly, let $\beta_{\phi_i}$ be the horizontal displacement generated by the rotational displacement between the central flag and $O_i$.
