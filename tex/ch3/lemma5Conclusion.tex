\textbf{Lemma \ref{lem:aux-C} Conclusion.} 
Reviewing the bounds in the proof of Lemma \ref{lem:aux-C}, the proof suffices by letting $\kappa = 5$.  
We have thus shown that the triple $(\alpha, \beta, \delta)$ for any obstacle hexagon is small and bounded.  
Therefore the entire modified auxiliary construction in any realization is canonical or close to canonical where the encoded P3SAT information is stable.
