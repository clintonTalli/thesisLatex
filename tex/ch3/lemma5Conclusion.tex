\textbf{Lemma \ref{lem:aux-C} Conclusion.} We have thus shown that the triple $(\alpha, \beta, \delta)$ for any obstacle hexagon is small and bounded.  
Therefore the entire modified auxiliary construction in any realization is canonical or close to canonical where the encoded P3SAT information is stable.
\end{proof}
