\section{Contact Graphs}
\begin{lem}\label{lem:ContactGraphV3-1}
For any natural number $k$,  there exists a tree $T = (V,E)$ with vertex weights $1$ and $1 - k^{-3}$ such that a stable $\BigOh{k^{-1}}$-approximation of a rectangle with ratio $\sqrt{3}$.
\end{lem}
\begin{thm}
It is NP Complete to decide whether a given tree with positive vertex weights is the contact graph of a disk arrangements with specified radii.
\end{thm}
