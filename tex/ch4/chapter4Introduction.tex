\chapter{Realizability Problems for Weighted Trees}\label{chp:disk}

We begin this chapter with the preliminary concepts to solving Problems \ref{problem:UnorderedContactGraph} and \ref{problem:OrderedContactGraph}, and then prove related Theorem \ref{thm:disk}.
Recall the Unordered and Ordered Realizability Problem  for a contact graph  and corresponding theorem which state:

\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Problem \ref{problem:UnorderedContactGraph}}] Given a planar graph with positive weighted vertices, is it a contact graph of some disk arrangement where the radii equal the vertex weights?
\item[\textbf{Problem \ref{problem:OrderedContactGraph}}] Given a planar graph with positive weighted vertices and a combinatorial embedding, is it a contact graph of some disk arrangement where the radii equal the vertex weights and the counter-clockwise order of neighbors of each disk is specified by the combinatorial embedding?
\item[\textbf{Theorem \ref{thm:disk}}] It is NP-Hard to decide whether a given tree (resp., plane tree) with positive vertex weights
is the contact graph (resp., contact graph) of a disk arrangements with specified radii.
\end{itemize}

The preliminary concepts are the Hausdorff distance, the Unit Disk Touching Graph Recongnition Problem, and the Perturbed Root with Unit Disk Leaves Touching Graph Recongnition Problem.
