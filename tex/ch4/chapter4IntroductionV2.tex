\chapter{Realizability Problems for Weighted Trees}\label{chp:disk}

In this chapter our goal is to prove Theorem \ref{thm:disk}: It is NP-Hard to decide whether a given tree with positive vertex weights is the contact graph of a disk arrangements with specified radii.   
This chapter's approach to proving Theorem \ref{thm:disk} introduces an ordered weighted tree $T$, perturbed ordered weight tree $T_\epsilon$, the Hausdorff distance, and then prove a lemma which shows that hexagons can be approximated by an ordered disk contact graph corresponding to the weighted tree $T_\epsilon$.
