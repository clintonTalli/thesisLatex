\chapter{Realizability Problems for Weighted Trees}\label{chp:disk}

In this chapter our goal is to prove Theorem \ref{thm:disk} which states: ``It is NP-Hard to decide whether a given tree with positive vertex weights is the contact graph of a disk arrangements with specified radii.''  
This chapter's approach to proving Theorem \ref{thm:disk} introduces an ordered weighted tree $T$ and perturbed ordered weight tree $T_\epsilon$, the Hausdorff distance, and then prove the following lemma:
\begin{lem}\label{lem:ch4IntroLemma}
for ever $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an ordered weighted tree $T_\epsilon$ such that every realization of $T_\epsilon$ as an ordered disk contact graph where the radii of the disks equal the vertex weights.
\end{lem} 
Using Lemma \ref{lem:ch4IntroLemma}, we prove Theorem \ref{thm:disk} by extending the modified auxiliary construction in Chapter \ref{chapter:polygonalLinkage}.  

We first cover the preliminary concepts of Hausdorff distance and the ordered weighted tree families of $T$ and $T_\epsilon$.  
We then continue with the proof of Lemma \ref{lem:ch4IntroLemma} and Theorem \ref{thm:disk}.
