% CHAPTER 4. OUTLINE

% In chapter 4, we show that for every epsilon>0 there exists an ordered
% weighted tree T_epsilon such that every realization of T_epsilon as an
% ordered disk contact graph, where the radii of the disks equal the
% vertex weights, has Housdorff distance at most epsilon 1 from a regular
% hexagon of unit side length. Once we establish this, we can prove
% Theorem 4 by extending the construction in Section 3 and simulating
% regular hexagons with ordered trees T_epsilon.

% Section 4.1 should define Hausdorff distance and eps-approximation; and
% provide a few examples.

% Section 4.2 should define the snowflake trees. It is an infinite family
% of ordered trees, say T_k,
% where teach axis contains k vertices.

% Section 4.3 should show that for every k, the snowflake tree (with
% vertex weights 1/2+delta and 1/2
% can be realized as a contact graph of disks; and this realization has
% Hausdorff distance at most 1
% from a regular Hexagon (of side length k). Let us also define a
% "canonical position" of the disk
% centers; where each center is a vertex of the hexagonal lattice. Note,
% however, that the canonical
% position does not give a valid realization!

% Section 4.4 should prove that in  _every_ realization of the snowflake
% tree T_k, every disks is "close"
% to their canonical position (here the term "close" must be
% quantified---an upper bound on the maximal distance of a disk from its
% canonical position comes from the proof).

% Section 4.5: Proof of Theorem 4 (this should be rather short: we simply
% state that the construciton of Section 3 can be repeated).

% -----------------------------------
% Lemma 1 in Chapter 4.

% The statement of the lemma is fine, just need to quantify it in terms of
% gamma.

% In the proof of the lemma, the formula
% y = 2\pi - 5( 2 \tan^{-1} frac{1}{2(1+gamma)}
%    = 2\pi - 10 \tan^{-1} frac{1}{2(1+gamma)}
% is great. Observe that if gamma=0, then y=pi/3.
% By continuity, for small values of gamma,
% y will be close to pi/3.

% Note that 1-1/(1+gamma) < gamma.
% Since the derivative of tan^{-1}(x) is less than 1;
% we conclude that  tan^{-1} frac{1}{2(1+gamma)}
% < tan^{-1}(frac{1}{2})  + frac{1}{2}(1-frac{1}{1+ gamma}
% < pi/3 + gamma/2.

% Caterpillar concept:

% A caterpillar can simulate a small rhombus.

% But the main point is Lemma 2 in that paper, which can be used directly
% for the proof of Lemma 2 in Chapter 4 (to show the displacement is small
% for every axis of the snowflake graph. .
