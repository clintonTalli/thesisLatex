% CHAPTER 3. (Labels refer to the file cat.pdf)

% Glossary of formulas:
% For arctan, sin, cos, and sec, I would give upper and lower bounds
% (rather than approximate values).
% For example, the Maclaurin series of tan^{-1} gives: x-\frac{x}{3} <
% \tan^{-1}x < x for all 0<x<1.
% All lowerupper bounds are derived from the first or the first two terms
% of the Maclaurin series.


% In (3.5), I would simply (5s^\kappa-1)^3  to (4s^\kamma)^3=4s^{3\kappa},
% which is true for sufficiently large values of s (above a constant
% threshold).
% This will simplify the formulae (3.5)--(3.10).

% Below Figure 3.18, the paragraph title "Vertical Displacement delta" is
% missing.

% Below Figure 3.20. You introduce omega, but you later use omega_i.
% I would define omega_i from the start.

% Below Figure 3.21, you consider the case that omega_i \leq \pi/2.
% It is unclear why the threshold is \pi/2. Shouldn't it be
% \pi/2-2arctan(1/100N), that is \pi/2 minus twice the angle of
% angle of the right triangle shown in the bottom of Figure 3.21?

% Lemma 7, and the calculation above it: I don't understand this lemma.
% I think the main argument should something line this:
% --If omega_i is close to pi, then O_{i+1} has a horizontal displacement
% of about 2 units, and it
% overlaps with another obstacle (which has small displacement by induction).
% --If omega_i is between 0 and pi (but not close to either 0 or pi), then
%   the top vertex of the small rombus is "too high,", contradicting the
% fact the
%    O_{i+1} has "small" vertical displacement (here the terms "too high" and
%    "small" can be quantified in terms of the parameter s).

% CHAPTER 4. OUTLINE

% In chapter 4, we show that for every epsilon>0 there exists an ordered
% weighted tree T_epsilon such that every realization of T_epsilon as an
% ordered disk contact graph, where the radii of the disks equal the
% vertex weights, has Housdorff distance at most epsilon 1 from a regular
% hexagon of unit side length. Once we establish this, we can prove
% Theorem 4 by extending the construction in Section 3 and simulating
% regular hexagons with ordered trees T_epsilon.

% Section 4.1 should define Hausdorff distance and eps-approximation; and
% provide a few examples.

% Section 4.2 should define the snowflake trees. It is an infinite family
% of ordered trees, say T_k,
% where teach axis contains k vertices.

% Section 4.3 should show that for every k, the snowflake tree (with
% vertex weights 1/2+delta and 1/2
% can be realized as a contact graph of disks; and this realization has
% Hausdorff distance at most 1
% from a regular Hexagon (of side length k). Let us also define a
% "canonical position" of the disk
% centers; where each center is a vertex of the hexagonal lattice. Note,
% however, that the canonical
% position does not give a valid realization!

% Section 4.4 should prove that in  _every_ realization of the snowflake
% tree T_k, every disks is "close"
% to their canonical position (here the term "close" must be
% quantified---an upper bound on the maximal distance of a disk from its
% canonical position comes from the proof).

% Section 4.5: Proof of Theorem 4 (this should be rather short: we simply
% state that the construciton of Section 3 can be repeated).

% -----------------------------------
% Lemma 1 in Chapter 4.

% The statement of the lemma is fine, just need to quantify it in terms of
% gamma.

% In the proof of the lemma, the formula
% y = 2\pi - 5( 2 \tan^{-1} frac{1}{2(1+gamma)}
%    = 2\pi - 10 \tan^{-1} frac{1}{2(1+gamma)}
% is great. Observe that if gamma=0, then y=pi/3.
% By continuity, for small values of gamma,
% y will be close to pi/3.

% Note that 1-1/(1+gamma) < gamma.
% Since the derivative of tan^{-1}(x) is less than 1;
% we conclude that  tan^{-1} frac{1}{2(1+gamma)}
% < tan^{-1}(frac{1}{2})  + frac{1}{2}(1-frac{1}{1+ gamma}
% < pi/3 + gamma/2.
% -----------------------------------

% Caterpillar concept:

% A caterpillar can simulate a small rhombus.

% But the main point is Lemma 2 in that paper, which can be used directly
% for the proof of Lemma 2 in Chapter 4 (to show the displacement is small
% for every axis of the snowflake graph. .
