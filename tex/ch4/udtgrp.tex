\section{Unit Disk Touching Graph Recongnition Problem (UDTGRP)}

In Figure \ref{fig:hexagonOutline5LayerSmall.pdf}, we have a set of unit radius disks (circles) arranged in a manner that outlines regular, concentric hexagons.

\begin{prob}[Appoximating Polygonal Shapes with Contact Graphs]\label{problem:ApproxShapesWithContactGraphs}
For every $\epsilon >0$ and polygon $P$, there exists a contact graph $G = (V,E)$  such that the Hausdorff distance $d(P,G) < \epsilon$
\end{prob}

Recall problems (\ref{problem:UnorderedContactGraph}) and (\ref{problem:OrderedContactGraph}): given a positive weighted tree, $T$, is $T$ the (ordered) contact graph of some disk arrangement where the radii are equal to the vertex weights.  For now, we'll focus on a particular family of this problem space where the weighted trees can be realized as a \textit{snowflake}. For $i \in \bbN$, the construction of the snowflake tree, $S_i$, is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $v_0$ be a vertex that has six paths attached to it: $p_1$, $p_2$, $\dots$, $p_6$.  Each path has $i$ vertices.
\item For every other path $p_1$, $p_3$, and $p_5$: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	Each vertex on that path has two paths attached, one path on each side of $p_k$.
		\item	The number of vertices that lie on the path attached to the $j^\text{th}$ vertex of $p_k$ is $i-j$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

A \textit{perfectly weighted snowflake tree} is a snowflake tree with all vertices having weight $\frac{1}{2}$.  A \textit{perturbed snowflake tree} is a snowflake tree with all vertices having weight of 1 with the exception of $v_0$;  in a perturbed snowflake tree, $v_0$ will have a weight of $\frac{1}{2} + \gamma$.  For our analysis, all realizations of any snowflake, perfect or perturbed, shall have $v_0$ fixed at origin.  This is said to be the canonical position under Hausdorff distance of the snowflake tree.   

\paragraph{Perfectly Weighted Snowflake Tree.}

Consider the graph of the triangular lattice with unit distant edges:
\begin{eqnarray*}
V &=& \left\lbrace a\cdot (1,0) + b \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) : a,b \in \bbZ \right\rbrace\\
E &=& \left\lbrace \left\lbrace u,v \right\rbrace : \vert\vert u-v \vert\vert = 1 \text{ and } u,v \in V\right\rbrace
\end{eqnarray*}
The following graph, $G=(V,E)$ is said to be the \textit{unit distance graph} of the triangular lattice.  We can show that no two distinct edges of this graph are non-crossing.  First suppose that there were two distinct edges that crossed, $\left\lbrace u_1,v_1 \right\rbrace $ and $\left\lbrace u_2,v_2 \right\rbrace$.  With respect to $u_1$, there are 6 possible edges corresponding to it, with each edge $\frac{\pi}{3}$ radians away from the next.  Neither edge crosses another; and so we have a contradiction that there are no edge crossings with $\left\lbrace u_1,v_1 \right\rbrace $.  


The perfectly weighted snowflake tree that is a subgraph over the \textit{unit distance graph}, $G=(V,E)$, of the triangular lattice.  To show this, for any $S_i$, fix $v_0 = 0 \cdot \cdot (1,0) + 0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)=\lr{0,0} \in V$ at origin.  Next consider the six paths attached from origin.  Fix each consecutive path $\frac{\pi}{3}$ radians away from the next such that the following points like on the corresponding paths: $\lr{1,0} \in p_1, \lr{\frac{1}{2} ,\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}} \in p_2,\lr{-\frac{1}{2}\p_4,\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} \in p_3, \lr{-1,0} \in p4, \lr{-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}\in p_5,\lr{\frac{1}{2},-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}\in p_6$.  For $S_i$, there are $i$ vertices on each path.  

We define the six paths from origin as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_1 &=& \set{a\cdot\lr{1,0} = \vec{v}}{a \in \bbR^+}\\
p_2 &=& \set{a\cdot\lr{\frac{1}{2},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \vec{v}}{a \in \bbR^+}\\
p_3 &=& \set{-a\cdot \lr{1,0} + a \cdot \lr{\frac{1}{2},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = a\lr{-\frac{1}{2},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \vec{v}}{a \in \bbR^+}\\
p_4 &=& \set{a \cdot \lr{-1,0} = \vec{v}}{a \in \bbR^+}\\
p_5 &=& \set{a \cdot \lr{-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}  = \vec{v}}{a \in \bbR^+}\\
p_6 &=& \set{ a\cdot \lr{1,0} - a \cdot \lr{\frac{1}{2},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}= a \cdot \lr{\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}}{a \in \bbR^+} 
\end{eqnarray*}
For $S_i$ there exists $i$ vertices on each path.  We shall denote the $i^\text{th}$ vertex on the $j^\text{th}$ path as $v_{j,i}$.  For each path defined above, the paths are defined as a set of vectors, $\vec{v} = a \cdot \vec{p}$  for some $a \in \bbR^+$ and $\vec{p} \in \bbR^2$.  By setting $a = 1,2,\dots, i$, we obtain points that are contained in $V$.  For $j = 1,3,5$ and $l = 1,..., i$, there exists two paths attached to each vertex $v_{j,l}$.  For $S_i$, each path attached to the $k^\text{th}$ vertex of $p_j$, there are $i-k$ vertices.  We will need to show that each of the $i-k$ vertices on each corresponding path are also in $V$.

The triangular lattice is symmetice under rotation about $v_0$ by $\frac{\pi}{3}$ radians.  For each vertex $v_{1,l}$ for $l=1,2,..., i-k$, we place two paths from it; the first path $\frac{\pi}{3}$ above $p_1$ at $v_{1,l}$ and $\frac{-\pi}{3}$ below $p_1$ at $v_{1,l}$ and call these paths $p_{1,l}^+$ and $p_{1,l}^-$ respectively.  With respect to $v_{1,l}$, one unit along $p_{1,l}^+$ is a point on the triangular lattice and similarly so on $p_{1,l}^-$.  Continuing the walk along these paths, unit distance-by-unit distance, we obtain the next point corresponding point on the the triangular lattice up to $i-k$ distance away from $v_{1,l}$.  This shows that each of the $i-k$ vertices on $p_{1,l}^-$ and $p_{1,l}^+$ are in $V$.  By rotating all of the paths along $p_1$ by $\frac{2\pi}{3}$ and $\frac{4\pi}{3}$, we obtain the the paths along $p_3$ and $p_5$ respectively, completing the construction.
