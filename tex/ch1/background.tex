\chapter{Background}
In this section, we cover the background subjects needed to formally pose the 
problems and present solutions in this thesis.  We start with two types of combinatorial structures, linkages 
and polygonal linkages.  We then discuss the configuration spaces of linkages and polygonal 
linkages.   We then look into an alternate representation of linkages, disk arrangements and state 
the disk arrangement theorem.  Next we look at satisfiability problems and then review a framework, the 
logic engine, which can encode a type of satisfiability problem.  Finally, we cover the basic 
definitions of algorithm complexity for $\textbf{P}$ and $\textbf{NP}$.
