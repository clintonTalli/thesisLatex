\chapter{Background}
% In this section, we cover the background subjects needed to formally pose the 
% problems and present solutions in this thesis.  We start with two types of combinatorial structures, linkages 
% and polygonal linkages.  We then discuss the configuration spaces of linkages and polygonal 
% linkages.   We then look into an alternate representation of linkages, disk arrangements and state 
% the disk arrangement theorem.  Next we look at satisfiability problems and then review a framework, the 
% logic engine, which can encode a type of satisfiability problem.  Finally, we cover the basic 
% definitions of algorithm complexity for $\textbf{P}$ and $\textbf{NP}$.
%
%Decidability problems study whether there exists a way to determine whether an element is a member of a set.  
%
In this thesis we consider four such decision problems surrounding graph theory and geometry. 
The first set of problems involve polygonal linkages and the second set of problems involve something called a contact graph of disks.  
In each problem, we decide whether a polygonal linkage or contact graph has a certain realization in the plane.

This thesis first presents preliminary information needed to pose our four problems, then we formally pose each problem and then provide the hardness results in all four cases.
We show that all four problems are intractable, or $\NP$ hard (see definition below).
