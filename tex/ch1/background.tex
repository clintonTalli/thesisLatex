\chapter{Background}

We consider four decision problems surrounding graph theory and geometry. 
The graph theory based problems involve polygonal linkages and the geometry based problems involve something called a contact graph of disks.  
In each problem, we decide whether a polygonal linkage or contact graph has a certain realization in the plane.

This thesis first presents preliminary information needed to pose our four problems, then we formally pose each problem and then provide the hardness results in all four cases.
We show that all four problems are intractable, or $\NP$ hard (see definition below).
