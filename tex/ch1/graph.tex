\section{Graphs}
A \textit{graph} is an ordered pair $G = (V,E)$ comprising of a set of vertices $V$ and a multiset of edges $E$.  
An edge is a 2 element subset of $V$ and denoted as ``V choose two'', ${V \choose 2}$.
% Each edge $e \in E$ is an unordered pair of vertices $\curlybraces{u,v} \in E$.  
Vertices are said to be \textit{adjacent} if they form an edge in $E$.  
\textit{Neighbors} of vertex $v$ are the adjecent vertices of $v$.
Vertices that are adjacent to themselves are \textit{self-adjacent}, i.e. $u = v$ for $\curlybraces{u,v} \in E$.  
Edges are said to be \textit{incident} if they share a vertex.  
When an edge is a member of $E$ multiple times, then we say that the graph is a \textit{multigraph}.   
A \textit{simple graph} has no self-adjacent vertices. 
If $G' = (V',E')$ such that $V' \subset V$ and $E' \subset E$, then $G'$ is a \textit{subgraph} of $G$.
Unless otherwise stated, this thesis will strictly work with simple graphs.

For graph equivalency, we need to define an isomorphism for graphs.  Given 
two graphs $G_1 =(V_1,E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2,E_2) $, a \textit{graph isomorphism} a bijective 
function $f: V_1 \mapsto 
V_2$ 
such that for any two vertices $u,v \in V_1$, we have $\{u, v\} \in E_1$, if and 
only 
if $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

$V_1$ and $V_2$ in the plane.}

To visualize a graph, $G$, we create a \textit{drawing} $\Gamma$, of $G$.  
For a drawing, we use an injective mapping $\Pi : V \mapsto \bbR^{2}$ which maps vertices to distinct points in the plane and for each edge $\curlybraces{u,v} \in E$, a continuous, injective mapping $c_{u,v}:[0,1]\mapsto \bbR^2$ such that $c_{u,v}(0) = \Pi(u)$ and $c_{u,v}(1) = \Pi(v)$. 
The \textit{crossing number} of a graph is the smallest number of edge crossings for a graph, i.e.
A drawing is said to be \textit{planar} if no two distinct edges cross \cite{BET+99}.
For this thesis, we will strictly work with straigt line drawings where all $c_{u,v}$ are straight line segments unless specified otherwise.


A \textit{crossing} is when two edges intersect.  
%The crossing number $cr\lr{\Gamma_G}$ of a drawing of $G$ is the number of crossings in the drawing of the graph $G$. 
%We can treat $cr()$ as a mapping from the space of drawings of $G$ to the non-negative integers, i.e. $cr: \left\lbrace \Gamma_G \right\rbrace \mapsto \bbZ^+ \cup \left\lbrace 0 \right\rbrace$.
%One can ask if for any graph $G$, does there exists a drawing in which the crossing number is zero?
%Without loss of generality, this is a type of crossing number minimization problem, i.e.
%$$ \min_{\gamma \in \left\lbrace \Gamma_G \right\rbrace} cr(\gamma)$$
Kuratowski's theorem allows one to characterize finite planar graphs, i.e. a finite graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ \cite{kuratowski1930probleme}. 
\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\includegraphics{graphics/kuratowskiExamples.pdf}
\caption{The $K_5$ and $K_{3,3}$ drawn in the plane.}\label{fig:kuratowskiExamples.pdf}
\end{center} 
\end{figure} 
%If no two distinct edges intersect in the drawing, the drawing is said to be \textit{planar}. 

A combinatorial \textit{embedding} is a planar drawing with a corresponding circular order of the neighbors of each vertex.
Two embeddings of a graph $G$ are equivalent if they determine the same circular orderings of the neighbor sets and the embeddings can be described as a combination of translations and rotations of the other.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics{graphics/equivalentWheelEmbedding.pdf}
    \caption{Here is a wheel graph, $W_5$, in two separate drawings with the same counterclock}\label{fig:equivalentWheelEmbedding.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{figure}



%Two planar drawings are equivalent if they determine the same circular orderings of the neighbor sets.
%Every proper drawing can be augmented to an embedded plane graph 
%by inserting new vertices at the edge crossings, and subdividing the edges that pass
%through those vertices. So the equivalence of two drawings reduces to the equivalence of plane graphs.


% A graph \textit{embedding} of $G = (V,E)$ is an injective mapping $\Pi: V \mapsto \bbR^2$.  
% \begin{figure}[!htbp]
% \begin{center}
% \includegraphics[scale=.5]{graphics/PetersonGraphExample.pdf}
% \caption{An embedding of the Peterson graph.}\label{fig:graph1-1}
% \end{center} 
% \end{figure} 
% A graph embedding is said to


% A \textit{graph} is an 
% ordered pair $G = (V,E)$ comprising of a set of vertices, $V$, and a set of edges or 
% lines, $E$.  Every edge $e \in E$, is an unordered pair of distinct vertices $u,v \in V$ (the edge represents their adjacency, $e = \{ u,v\}$). With this definition of a graph, there 
% are 
% no loops (self adjacent vertices, $\{v,v\}$) or multi-edges (several edges between the same pair of 
% vertices).

%   This requires an 
% embedding into the plane or $\bbr^3$.  An \textit{embedding} of the 
% graph $G = (V,E)$ is an injective mapping $\Pi : V \mapsto \bbR^{2}$ (see Figure 
% \ref{fig:graph1-1}). 


% \subsubsection{Edge Crossings}
% We define \textit{plane embeddings} of a graph to be an embedding where the following degenerate 
% configurations 
% do not occur:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item[\rn{1}] the interiors of two or more edges intersect, or
% \item[\rn{2}] an edge passes through a vertex
% \end{itemize}

% \caption{These figures exhibit the 4 types of edge crossings.}\label{fig:ch1-linkages-1}

% A graph is called \textit{planar} if it admits a plane embedding.  A \textit{plane graph} is a 
% graph together with a plane embedding.

\subsection{Trees}
Some graphs can be classified by which properties they have.
A \textit{path} is a sequence of vertices in which every two consecutive vertices are connected by an edge.   
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{graphics/PetersonGraphWithPath.pdf}
\caption{An embedding of the Peterson graph with a simple cycle of 
(2,7,9,6,1,0,5,8,3).}\label{fig:ch1-graph-2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A \textit{simple cycle} of a graph is a sequence, $(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{t-1},v_t)$, of distinct vertices such that every two consecutive vertices are connected by an edge,  and the last vertex, $v_t$, connects to $v_1$.  
A graph is \textit{connected} if for any two vertices, there exists a path between the two points.
A \textit{tree} is a graph that has no simple cycles and is connected.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{graphics/RandomTree.pdf}
\caption{An example of a tree.}\label{fig:ch1-graph-2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Any two embeddings of trees are equivalent if they can be described as any combination of rotations, translations, and or reflections.

% \subsection{Ordered Trees}
An \textit{ordered tree} is a tree $T$ together with a cyclic order of the neighbors for each vertex, $O$.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics{graphics/OrderedTreesExample.pdf}
    \caption{A tree with two embeddings with different cyclic orderings around 
vertices.}\label{fig:ch1-graph-6}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Embeddings of ordered trees are equivalent if for each node the counter-clockwise ordering of 
adjacent nodes are the same and can be described as a combination of translations and rotations of the other.
Unlike embeddings for planar graphs where ordering of adjacent vertices is not a distinguishing condition,  we do not consider reflection based transformations for embeddings of ordered trees for equivaliency as that can modify the ordering of adjacent vertices.



% \subsection{Graph Isomorphism} 

% Next we add restrictions to our graph isomorphisms to narrow our focus:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item[\rn{1}] We focus on isomorphisms for planar graphs and or polygonal linkages, simple planar 
% graphs, and
% \item[\rn{2}] the isomorphism preserves edge lengths (polygonal area), e.g. $d(u,v) = d(f(u),f(v))$.
% \end{itemize}  
% With these restrictions of our isomorphisms, we can begin to describe a range of motion to 
% transform a linkage.  That range of motion is said to be the configuration space of that linkage.  
% To expand on this concept, for given linkage, $L=(V,E)$, and for a given vertex $v \in V$, the set 
% of points in which $v$ can be realized in the plane would be the configuration space for that 
% vertex, $C_v$.  Defining some order of the vertices in $L$, i.e. $V = \left\lbrace v_n 
% \right\rbrace_{i=1}^n$, then the \it{configuration space} for $L$ is said to be the cartesion 
% product of the configuration space of vertices:

% % \end{equation} 
% % Some food for thought on configuration spaces and motions on linkages:
% % \begin{itemize}
% % \item[\rn{1}] A configuration space is said to be \it{connected} if there is a continuous mapping 
% for any two planar realizations (linkages) of a graph in the plane.  Otherwise it is said to be 
% \it{disconnected}.
% % \item[\rn{2}] If the configuration space of a vertex, $C_v$, is a singleton set, then the vertex 
% is said to be \it{pinned}. Otherwise it is said to be \it{free}.
% % \item[\rn{3}] The types of motions (mappings) that we refrain from using on linkages are 
% translations.
% % \end{itemize}
% % Note that configuration spaces for polygonal linkages are described similarly.
% % \subsubsection{Realizability of Linkages}
% % Suppose we had two configurations of a linkage, $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$.  A question that 
% can be posed is can we reconfigure $\mathcal{A}$ to $\mathcal{B}$ continuously while respecting 
% simple planar graph conditions?  The answer to this question is a yes or no.  If yes, then there 
% must exist a path connected configuration space between $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$.  It has 
% been shown that this problem can be posed as a planar satisfiability problem 
% \cite{Breu19983,mulzer2008minimum} (Later on in this paper we'll cover satisfiability problems).  
% This is the type of problem that we face in this paper.  We will continue to explore this in a 
% different manner, with circle packings.
