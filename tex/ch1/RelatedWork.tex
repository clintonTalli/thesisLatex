\section{Related Work and Results}
Boris Klemz's Master's thesis ``Weighted Disk Contact Graph'' shows the Unit Disk Touching Graph Recognition problem is NP-Hard.  
% In Chapter 2 we investigate recognition problems with uniform (and ρ-bounded) radii. In Section 2.1 we consider the Unit Disk Touching Graph Recognition (UDT) problem and strengthen the result of Breu and Kirkpatrick [BK98] by showing that the UDT problem is NP-hard even for outerplanar graphs. On the positive side, we provide a linear-time algorithm for deciding the UDT problem in caterpillars. In this section we also briefly consider ρ-bounded Disk Touching Graph Recognition and show that for spiders this problem can be solved in linear time in the Real RAM model. In Section 2.2 we extend our result from the previous section by showing that the Unit Disk Touching Graph Recognition with fixed Embedding (UDTE) problem is also NP-hard, even for outerplanar graphs.
% In Chapter 3 we explore the more general scenario with fixed but not necessarily uniform radii. In Section 3.1 we consider the Disk Touching Graph Recognition with fixed Radii (DTR) problem and strengthen the result by Breu and Kirkpatrick [BK98] by showing that the DTR problem is NP-hard even for stars. We also show that for any cycle and a corresponding radius assignment there exists a realizing disk touching graph. In contrast, in Section 3.2 we devise a linear-time algorithm for deciding the Disk Touching Graph Recognition with fixed Radii and Embedding (DTRE) problem for stars in the Real RAM model.
% In Chapter 4 we concern ourself with the scenario in which a seed assignment is required to be respected. In Section 4.1 we strengthen the result of Atienza et al. [AdCC+12] by showing that the Disk Touching Graph Recognition with fixed Seeds (DTS) prob- lem is NP-hard even for trees. In Section 4.2 we combine this scenario with assigning fixed radii, more specifically uniform radii. We show that the Unit Disk Touching Graph Recognition with fixed Seeds (UDTS) problem is NP-hard, even for paths, implying that the Unit Disk Touching Graph Recognition with fixed Seeds and Embedding (UDTSE) problem is also NP-hard even for paths.
It also improves the Breu and Kirkpatrick result on Disk Touching Graph Recognition problem \cite{klemzthesis,BK98}.
