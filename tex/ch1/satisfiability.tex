\section{Satisfiability}\label{sec:logic}
Let $x_1, \dots, x_n$ be boolean variables.  A boolean formula is a combination of conjunction, 
disjunctions, and negations of the boolean variables $x_1,  \dots, x_n$.   
A \textit{clause} is a disjunction of distinct literals.  
A \textit{literal} is a variable or a negated variable, $x_i$ or $\bar{x}_i$, for $i = 1,\dots,n$. 
A boolean formula is \textit{satisfiable} if one can assign true or false value to each variable so that the formula is true. 
It is known that every boolean formula can be rewritten in \textit{conjunctive normal form} (CNF), a conjunction of clauses, via DeMorgan's law and distributive law.   
Furthermore, it is also known that every boolean formula can be written in CNF such that each clause has exactly three literals. 
This form is called 3-CNF.  
For example, consider the clause $A \lor B \lor C \lor D \lor E$. 
This clause can be rewritten in 3-CNF form as $(A \lor B \lor x_1) \land (\lnot x_1 \lor C \lor x_2) \land (\lnot x_2 \lor D \lor E)$ where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are literals that allow us to form 3-CNF clauses.
Here are the problem statements for satisfiability:
%\textit{3-SAT problem}.
\begin{prob}[Satisfiability Problem (SAT)]\label{prob:Satisfiability-1}%Problem/Question
Given a boolean formula, is it satisfiable? \cite{skiena2009algorithm}
\end{prob} 
\textit{Brute force} is when an algorithm tries all possibilities to see if any formulates a satisfiable solution.
It is clear that SAT is decidable in exponential time by testing all possibilities.
This is callled a brute force solution.
It is not known whether SAT admits a polynomial time solution, that is whether it is in $\P$. 
\begin{prob}[3-SAT Problem]
Given a boolean formula in 3-CNF, is it satisfiable?
\end{prob}
The problems we focus on in this thesis have a geometry.  
A special geometric 3-SAT problem is that Planar 3-SAT Problem.   
Given a 3-CNF boolean formula, $\Phi$, with $n$ variables and $m$ clauses, 
we define the \textit{associated graph} $A(\Phi)$ as follows: the vertices correspond to the variables and clauses in $\Phi$.   
We place an edge in the graph if variable $x_i$ appears in clause $C_j$.

\end{figure} 
\begin{prob}[Planar 3-SAT]
 Given a boolean formula $\Phi$ in 3-CNF such that its associated graph is planar, decide whether it 
is satisfiable is a \textit{3-SAT problem}.
\end{prob}
Figure \ref{fig:assoc} is associated to a family of boolean formulas.  
One such associated boolean formula is:
$$(x_1 \lor x_3 \lor \lnot x_5) \land (\lnot x_1 \lor \lnot x_2 \lor x_3) \land (\lnot x_3 \lor x_4 \lor \lnot x_5) \land (x_2 \lor x_4 \lor \lnot x_5) \land ( \lnot x_1 \lor x_2 \lor x_5)$$
Note that the figure establishes an edge relation between variables and clauses whereas the clauses in boolean formulas do not have variables but literals of variables.
\begin{prob}[Not All Equal 3 SAT Problem (NAE3SAT)]\label{prob:Satisfiability-2}%Problem/Question
Given a boolean formula in 3-CNF, is it satisfiable so that each clause contains a 
true and a false literal?
\end{prob}

Problems \ref{prob:Satisfiability-1}---\ref{prob:Satisfiability-2} are known to be NP-hard and are often used to show other problems are NP-hard as well \cite{lichtenstein1982planar,karp1972reducibility}.

% Given a boolean 3-SAT formula $B$, define the associated graph of $B$ as follows:  
% \begin{equation}\label{eqn:sat-1}
% G(B) = \left(\set{v_x}{v_x\text{ represents a variable in }B} \cup \set{v_C}{v_C\text{ represent a 
% clause in }B}  , \set{\left( v_x, v_C\right) }{x \in C \text{ or } \bar{x} \in C}  \right) 
% \end{equation} 
% If $G(B)$ in equation (\ref{eqn:sat-1}) is planar, then $B$ is said to be a \textit{Planar 3-SAT 





%3-SAT, PLANAR 3-SAT, NAE3SAT are NP hard [ADD REFERENCE].  THE PROOF FOR THESE REDUCTIONS ARE NOT 
%OBVIOUS BUT ARE SHOWN [HERE, THERE, AND OVER THERE] respectively.
% Definition 1. (PLANAR 3-SAT) Let Φ be a
% Boolean formula in 3-CNF. The formula graph of
% Φ, G(Φ), has one variable-vertex vx for each variable
% x and one clause-vertex vC for each clause C. The
% variable-vertices vx are connected by edges to form a
% variable cycle, and for each clause-vertex vC an edge
% (vC, vx) is added if C contains either literal x or x.
% We say Φ is planar iﬀ G(Φ) is planar. The PLANAR
% 3-SAT problem is equivalent to the 3-SAT problem
% restricted to planar formulae.
% Theorem 2.1. (Lichtenstein [14] Theorem 2)
% PLANAR 3-SAT is NP-complete
% \begin{prob}[Planar 3 SAT Problem]
%  A planar 3SAT instance is a 3SAT instance for which the graph built using the following rules is 
% planar:
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item add a vertex for every $x_i$ and $\bar{x}_i$
%  \item add a vertex for every clause $C_j$
%  \item add an edge for every $\left(x_i,\bar{x}_i \right)$ pair
%  \item add an edge from vertex $x_i$ (or $\bar{x}_i$) to each vertex that represent a clause that 
% contains it
%  \item add edges between two consecutive variables $(x_1,x_2)$, $(x_2,x_3)$, $\dots$,$(x_n,x_1)$
% \end{enumerate}
% In particular, rule 5 builds a "backbone" that splits the clauses in two distinct regions.

%%Universality component
%\subsection{Logic Engine}
%The logic engine simulates the well known Not All Equal 3 SAT Problem (NAE3SAT).  
%%add figure of logic engine.
%\subsection{Construction of the Logic Engine}
%The components of the logic engine are as follows: the rigid frame, the shaft, the armatures, 
%the chains, and the flags.  The \textit{rigid frame} is a rectangular enclosure with a horizontal 
%shaft place at mid-height.  The \textit{armatures} are concentric rectangular frames contained 
%within the rigid frame.  Each armature can rotate about the shaft; other motions on the armature 
%are disallowed.  Given an NAE3SAT, for each variable there is a corresponding armature. On each 
%armature, there are chains.  A pair of \textit{chains}, $a_j$ and $\bar{a}_j$ correspond to the 
%variable $x_j$ and $\bar{x}_j$ respectively.  The pair is placed on each armature, reflected at a 
%height of $h$ above and below the shaft, i.e. one place above the shave at a height of $h$, the 
%other placed below the shaft at a height of $-h$.
%%insert an armature graphic
%
%\subsection{Encoding the Logic Engine}
%For each clause of an NAE3SAT, there exists a set of corresponding chains, namely the $h^\text{th}$ 
%clause is the set of chains on the armatures at the $h^\text{th}$ row above and below the shaft. A 
%chain is \textit{flagged} if the corresponding variable resides within the clause.  The flag can 
%point in either the left or right directions indicating a truth assignment for that variable within 
%the clause.  A flag is attached to the $i^\text{th}$ chain of every $a_j^\text{th}$ and 
%$\bar{a}_j^\text{th}$ chain with the following exceptions:
%\begin{enumerate}
% \item if the variable $x_j$  is in clause $C_i$, then link $i$ of $a_j$ is unflagged,
% \item if the variable $\bar{x}_j$ is in clause $C_i$, then link $i$ of $a_j$ is unflagged.
%\end{enumerate}
%\begin{thm}\label{thm:Satisfiability-1}
% An instance of $NAE3SAT$ is a ``yes'' instance if and only if the corresponding logic engine has a 
%flat, collision-free configuration.
%\end{thm}
%\begin{pf}
% If an instance of $NAE3SAT$ is a ``yes'', then every clause in $C$ contains at least one true 
%variable and one false variable.  Now suppose the following truth assignment:
%\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Satisfiability-1}
% t\left( x_j \right) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{cr}
%  1 & x_j\text{ and }\bar{x}_j \text{are placed at the top and bottom respectively}\\
%  0 & x_j\text{ and }\bar{x}_j \text{are placed at the bottom and top respectively}\\
% \end{array}\right.
%\end{equation}
%For each clause $c_i \in C$, there exists a variables in $c_i$ such that $t\left( y_i \right) = 1$ 
%and $t\left( z_i \right) = 0$.  This implies that there exists an unflagged chain in the 
%$i^\text{th}$ and $-i^\text{th}$ row of the frame.  To avoid a collision in each row, trigger the 
%flags to point towards the unflagged link. Thus, the corresponding logic engine has a 
%flat, collision-free configuration.
%
%If the corresponding logic engine has a flat, collision-free configuration, then there must exist 
%an unflagged link in each row.  Without loss of generality, we have that the variables $y_j$ and 
%$z_i$ is in clause $C_i$ such that $t\left( y_i \right) = 1$ and $t\left( z_i \right) = 0$ for each 
%$i$.  Thus, we have an instance of $NAE3SAT$ is a ``yes'' instance. \cite{BET+99}
