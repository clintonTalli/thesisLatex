When graphs model physical objects, distances between adjacent vertices matter. The length 
assignment of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is $l:E \mapsto \bbr^+$. A \textit{linkage} is a graph $G = 
(V,E)$ with a length assignment $l:E \mapsto \bbr^+$.  We consider embeddings of a graph that 
respects the length assignment.  A \textit{realization} of a linkage, $G$ and $l$, is an embedding 
fo a graph, $\Pi$, such that for every edge $\{u,v\} \in E$, $l\left( \{u,v\} \right) 
= \left\vert \Pi(u) - \Pi(v) \right\vert$.

% A \textit{linkage} is an ordered pair $G = (V,E)$ comprising of a set $V$ of vertices or nodes 
% together with a set $E$ of edges or lines. This definition is commonly used for graphs.  Mapping 
% the linkage $G$ into the plane is said to be the \textit{embedding}, i.e. $L : V \mapsto 
% \bbR^{2}$.  A length function correspond to a linkage, $l: E \mapsto \bbr^+$ gives a length to an 
% edge in the linkage.  If We consider a \textit{realization} of a linkage is range of $L$, i.e. 
% $L(V)$. If for every edge $(u,v) \in E$ such that $l\left( \left(u,v\right) \right) = \left\vert 
% L(u) - L(v) \right\vert$ is true, then $L$ is said to be a \textit{proper embedding} of $G$.
