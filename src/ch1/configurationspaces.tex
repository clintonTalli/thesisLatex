\section{Configuration Spaces}
\begin{quote}
Just as one can compose colors or forms, so one can compose motions.

We'd like to describe motions and range of motions of embedded graphs, linkages, polygonal 
linkages, and disk arrangements.

\begin{thm}[\cite{CDR03,Str05}Carpenter's Rule Theorem]
 Every realization of a linkage can be continuously moved (without 
self-intersection) to any other 
realization. In other words, the realization space of such a linkage is always connected.
\end{thm}
A configuration space is \textit{connected} if for any two configurations, there is .....
\subsection{Configuration Spaces of Linkages}
Let's focus on the space of embeddings of a linkage. If there are $n$ vertices of a linkage, 
the \textit{configuration space} of a linkage is said to be a vector space of dimension $2 \cdot n$ 
where edge length is preserved.  
\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[scale=.75]{graphics/twoEmbeddingsOfSameLinkage.pdf}
\end{center} 
\caption{(a) and (b) show a linkage in two embeddings.}
\label{fig:configuration-3}
\end{figure}
A \textit{configuration space} for a linkage $G$ and corresponding proper embedding, $L_1$ is said 
to be for any other proper embedding of a linkage $G$, $L_2$, such that the lengths 
of every edge of $G$ is preserved between the two embeddings, i.e.: 
$$l\left( \left(u,v\right) 
\right) = \left\vert 
L_1(u) - L_1(v) \right\vert = \left\vert L_2(u) - L_2(v) \right\vert$$
Equivalent embeddings include translations and rotations about the center of mass on $L(V)$.  We 
further our embeddings by requiring that one vertice is pinned to the point of origin on the plane 
as well as a neighboring vertex.

% \paragraph{Confining Linkages to a Restricted Space Within a Configuration Space}
% So we've covered the idea of linkages within a plane; now let's constrain the plane to a strip and 
% have a linkage that is a \textit{polygon}, i.e. a linkage that forms a closed chain (e.g. Table 
% \ref{table:linkage-1}), hugging the boundaries of the strip:

%   ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \quad, \qquad etc.
%     %(or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)
%   \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
% 	  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graphics/hexagonInChannelWithPinnedJointRight.pdf}
% 	  \caption{A bounded hexagon that resides in a channel with a pinned vertex}
% 	  \label{fig:linkage-1-1}
%   \end{subfigure}
%   \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
% 	  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graphics/hexagonInChannelWithPinnedJointLeft.pdf}
% 	  \caption{The second realization of the hexagon residing in a channel with a pinned 
% vertex.}
% 	  \label{fig:linkage-1-2}
%   \end{subfigure}
% \end{center} 
% \caption{Due to the strip in the plane that the hexagon is bounded within the configuration space is 
% limited to just two realizations.}\label{fig:linkage-1}
% \end{figure}
% So here we have a linkage whose conifguration space is limited to just two realizations.  With just 
% two realizations, we can assign a binary value to them and have the linkage act as a boolean 
% variable.  We will revisit this concept when we cover satisfiability problems later on in the paper.

%   \end{subfigure}
% \caption{Suppose the channel formed is a junction of three regular hexagons.  The polygon partially 
% residing in the junction is a regular hexagon with an equalateral triangle appended at an edge.  
% This polygon would prevent other polygons (i.e. the dashed polygons) of the same shape residing in 
% the center of the channel without intersection. This demonstrates that a the configuration space 
% within a multichannel environment can have concurrency issues, i.e. some configurations cannot be 
% realizable.}

% Expanding upon the idea of \ref{fig:linkage-1}, forming channels with junctions as shown in Figure 
% \ref{fig:linkage-2} can be formed as such by evenly spacing the edges of a hexagonal lattice.  
% Visually, it is shown that only one of three possible pentagons can reside in the channel at one 
% time.  By asserting certain conditions on the lattice, and extending the problem to a greater 
% region 
% of a hexagonal lattice, we will be able to pose a realizability problem of whether a configuration 
% $\mathcal{A}$ can be reconfigured to $\mathcal{B}$ by switching pentagons without violating 
% overlapped polygon conditions.
