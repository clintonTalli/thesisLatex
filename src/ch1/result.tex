\begin{prob}[Unordered Realizibility Problem for Linkages]
For a linkage, it asks 
whether its corresponding graph is the contact graph (resp., ordered contact graph) of some disk 
arrangement with specified radii.
\end{prob}
\begin{prob}[Unordered Realizibility Problem for Polygonal Linkages]
The \emph{realizability} problem for a polygonal linkage asks whether a given polygonal linkage has 
a realization.
\end{prob}
\begin{prob}[Ordered Realizibility Problem for Linkages]
For a linkage, it asks 
whether its corresponding graph is the ordered contact graph of some 
disk arrangement with specified radii.
\end{prob}
\begin{prob}[Ordered Realizibility Problem for Polygonal Linkages]
The \emph{realizability} problem for a ordered polygonal linkage asks whether a given polygonal 
linkage has a realization with respect to order.
