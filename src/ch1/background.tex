\chapter{Background}
In this section, we cover the background subjects needed to formally pose the 
problem and solutions in this thesis.  We start with two types of combinatorial structures, linkages 
and polygonal linkages.  We then discuss the configuration spaces of linkages and polygonal 
linkages.   We then look into an alternate representation of linkages, disk arrangements and state 
the disk arrangement theorem but do not show its proof.  We then look at satisfiability problems, a 
logic engine that encodes a type of satisfiability problems.  Finally, we cover the basic 
definitions of algorithm complexity for $\textbf{P}$ and $\textbf{NP}$.
