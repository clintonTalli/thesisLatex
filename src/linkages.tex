\subsection{Linkages}
Given a \it{graph}, an ordered pair $G = (V,E)$, comprising of a set $V$ of vertices or nodes together with a set $E$ of edges or lines, then a linkage of $G$ is the realization (or embedding) of $G$ in $\bbr^2$. For this paper, we focus on linkages that are simple planar  graphs, i.e.:
\begin{itemize}
\item[\rn{1}] does not have multiple edges between any pair of vertices,
\item[\rn{2}] does not have edges that cross, or
\item[\rn{3}] have loops (i.e. $(v,v) \in E$).
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Configuration Spaces of Linkages}
To describe the types of motion that we are interested in linkages we must define the graph isomorphism.  Two graphs $G=(V_1,E_1)$ and $\Gamma = (V_2,E_2) $, a bijection $f: V_1 \mapsto V_2$ such that for any two vertices $u,v \in V_1$ that are adjacent, i.e. $(u, v) \in E_1$, if and only if $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$. 
\begin{table}[!ht]
\begin{center}
$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\hline
\text{Graph}&\text{Vertices}&\text{Edges}\\\hline
G&\left\lbrace a,b,c,d,e \right\rbrace & \left\lbrace (a,b),(b,c),(c,d),(d,e),(e,a) \right\rbrace \\\hline
\Gamma&\left\lbrace 1,2,3,4,5 \right\rbrace & \left\lbrace (1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,1) \right\rbrace \\\hline
\end{array} $$

\end{center} 
\end{table} 

Next we add restrictions to our graph isomorphisms to narrow our focus:
\begin{itemize}
\item[\rn{1}] We focus on isomorphisms for simple planar graphs, and
\item[\rn{2}] the isomorphism preserves edge lengths, e.g. $d(u,v) = d(f(u),f(v))$.
\end{itemize}  
With these restrictions of our isomorphisms, we can begin to describe a range of motion to transform a linkage.  That range of motion is said to be the configuration space of that linkage.  To expand on this concept, for given linkage, $L=(V,E)$, and for a given vertex $v \in V$, the set of points in which $v$ can be realized in the plane would be the configuration space for that vertex, $C_v$.  Defining some order of the vertices in $L$, i.e. $V = \left\lbrace v_n \right\rbrace_{i=1}^n$, then the \it{configuration space} for $L$ is said to be the cartesion product of the configuration space of vertices:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:linkages-1}
C(L) = C_{v_1} \cross C_{v_2} \cross \cdots \cross C_{v_n}
\end{equation} 
Some food for thought on configuration spaces and motions on linkages:
\begin{itemize}
\item[\rn{1}] A configuration space is said to be \it{connected} if there is a continuous mapping for any two planar realizations (linkages) of a graph in the plane.  Otherwise it is said to be \it{disconnected}.
\item[\rn{2}] If the configuration space of a vertex, $C_v$, is a singleton set, then the vertex is said to be \it{pinned}. Otherwise it is said to be \it{free}.
\item[\rn{3}] The types of motions (mappings) that we refrain from using on linkages are translations.
\end{itemize} 
\subsubsection{Realizability of Linkages}
Suppose we had to configurations of a linkage, $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$.  Can we reconfigure $\mathcal{A}$ to $\mathcal{B}$ continuously while respecting simple planar graph conditions?  This is the type of problem that we face in this paper.  We will continue to explore this in a different manner, with circle packings.
% \begin{definition}[Graph]\label{def:linkages-2}
% An ordered pair $G = (V, E)$ comprising a set $V$ of vertices or nodes together with a set $E$ of edges or lines

% \begin{definition}[Linkage]\label{def:linkages-1}
% A collection of fixed-length 1D segments joined at their endpoints to form a graph.
% \end{definition} 
% A linkage can be thought of as a type of path-connected graph, i.e. the segments of a linkage are the edges of a graph, and the endpoints of the segments are the vertices. For this paper, we restrict our self to linkages that are simple planar graphs, i.e. a linkage that:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item[\rn{1}] does not have multiple edges between any pair of vertices,
% \item[\rn{2}] does not have edges that cross, or
% \item[\rn{3}] have loops (i.e. $(v,v) \in E$).
% \end{itemize}  
% \begin{definition}[Cycle]\label{def:linkages-3}
%  A closed walk with no repetitions of vertices or edges allowed, other than the repetition of the starting and ending vertex
% \end{definition} 
% \begin{definition}[Configuration]\label{def:linkages-6}
% A specification of the location of all the link endpoints, link orientations and
% joint angles.\cite{demaine2008geometric}
% \end{definition}
% \begin{definition}[Configuration Space]\label{def:linkages-7}
% The space of all configurations of a linkage.
% \end{definition} 
% A configurations space is said to be continuous if for any two configurations, $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ of a linkage $L$, $\mathcal{A}$ can be continuously reconfigured to $\mathcal{B}$ such that, the reconfigurations reside in the configuration domain, $L$ remains rigid throughout reconfiguration (i.e. all links' lengths are preserved), and no violations of linkage intersection conditions. 
% \begin{definition}[Pinned Joint]\label{def:linkages-8}
% A vertex of a graph (or linkage) that is fixed to a position in a plane.
% \end{definition} 
% \begin{definition}[Free Joint]\label{def:linkages-8}
% A vertex of a graph (or linkage) that is not fixed to a position in a plane.
