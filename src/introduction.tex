We look into the decidability of whether a hinged configuration locks.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
We need the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item[\rn{1}] discussion on the outer configuration of hexagons
\item[\rn{2}] discussion on the inner configuration (lattice tesselation) of hexagons the convex hull of \rn{1}
\item[\rn{3}] discussion on the hinged cells that reside in the boundary of \rn{2}
\item[\rn{4}] discussion on the lockedness of \rn{3} where it has two modes (boolean variable)
\item[\rn{5}] the area of interests:
\begin{itemize}
\item how big are the cells of \rn{3}?
\item does cell size matter in \rn{3}?
\item How to form a 3-sat conjunction from a set of cells at corners of the individual hexagons within the tesselation
\item how to form a conjunction from a set of cells on the edges of the of the hexagons.
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
